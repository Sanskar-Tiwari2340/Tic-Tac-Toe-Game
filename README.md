# Tic Tac Toe Game

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player strategy game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking empty squares with their respective symbols, typically "X" and "O". The objective is to be the first to get three of your marks in a row â€” vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

## How to Play

1. The game board consists of nine squares arranged in a 3x3 grid.
2. Two players alternate turns, with one playing "X" and the other playing "O".
3. On each turn, a player marks one empty square.
4. The first player to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
5. If all nine squares are filled without any player achieving three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
